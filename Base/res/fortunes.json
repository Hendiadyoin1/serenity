And this was the first day.\n4 On the second day, Andreas created the Kernel, and He said: 'Let us make it 32-bit x86! It surely won't cause problems later.'\n5 And in His infinite wisdom He saw that it was good.\n6 On the third day, Andreas created LibGUI. And there were widgets, and He saw that it was good.\n7 On the fourth day, Andreas created the Agnostic Kit.\n8 And the C++ Standard Library flinched and covered its eyes before the greatness that was the library now called 'AK'.\n9 On the fifth day, Andreas created the ELF loader.\n10 And the binaries wouldn't segfault anymore, and He saw that it was good.\n11 On the sixth day, Andreas created the EXT2 filesystem loader.\n12 And He could read his Text Files full of Memes, and He saw that it was good.\n13 On the seventh day, Andreas called upon The Mighty GitHub and said: 'Mighty GitHub, owned by the Corporation That Shall Not Be Named!\n14 I summon Thee, to make a place for my code, for it shall be available in one Repository, for all of mankind to look at!'\n15 And The Mighty GitHub listened, and there was a repository. And He saw that it was good.\n16 On the eighth day, Andreas got all parts running together, and the Real GUI would show up after boot.\n17 But there was no order yet, as the Processes made System Calls to draw graphics, and the Window Server was in the Kernel. And Andreas saw that it was a Hack, but it was good for now.\n18 On the ninth day, Andreas created the Browser. And it would crash on The Corporation That Shall Not Be Named's Web Site, but it wasn't complete anyways.\n19 And Andreas saw that it was a start, and He saw that it was good.\n20 On the tenth day, Andreas rested and admired his creation continued hacking on the system as an increasing number of contributors joined in.\n21 (editor's note: this part has not been written yet)\"",
